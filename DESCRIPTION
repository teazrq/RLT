Description: Random forest with a variety of additional features for regression, 
             classification, survival analysis and graphical model. New features 
             include parallel computing with OpenMP, reproduciblity with random 
             seeds, variance and confidence band estimations, embedded model 
             for selecting splitting varibles and constructing linear combination 
             splits, observaton and variable weights, setting and tracking subjects 
             used in each tree, etc.
